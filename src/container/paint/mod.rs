//! Facilities for orchestrating drawing content to the screen
//!
//! The primary type exposed by this module is [`Painter`], which is passed around to anything that
//! may want to draw to the screen. This is handled internally by the [`Buffer`] it references,
//! which is what actually writes to STDOUT.
//!
//! A small collection of helper types and traits are also provided. Inside each cell of the buffer
//! is a [`Symbol`], which corresponds to a single unicode grapheme. These are primarily produced
//! by the implementations of the [`IntoSymbols`] trait. Additionally, painters may be [`split`] to
//! divide regions of the screen - the direction and amount are handled by the [`Extract`] type,
//! which exists solely for that purpose.
//!
//! [`split`]: Painter::split
