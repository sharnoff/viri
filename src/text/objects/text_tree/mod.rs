/// A view into a text object with a particular byte encoding and optional styling
///
/// `TextTree`s are intended to provide *nearly* all of the utilites to directly write to the
/// screen, though some additional layers may be required -- like styling. There are actually
/// enough methods here that I find it helpful to generate & examine the documentation for it,
/// instead of just trying to read through the file. The existing functionality is given in the
/// form of:
/// * Access to individual lines as `String`s, and
/// * Editing by (line, column) and `String`s instead of byte
///
/// Both of these are accomplished with the `Enc` parameter, which specifies the encoding of the
/// bytes (i.e. a mapping from bytes to strings).
///
/// The `Time` and `Tag` parameters are simply forwarded on to the underlying [`SharedByteTree`].
///
/// All of the same general methods of interacting with a [`SharedByteTree`] are re-exported here,
/// with small wrappers around them to ensure state consistency and proper cache invalidation.
/// Everything should "just work".
///
/// While not specified in the type *definition*, all methods require that `Enc` implement
/// [`Encoding`].

    /// for all circumstances, unfortunately, so we reject edits that conflict with something that

    /// the internal lock. This should help limit any accidentally racy behavior here.

    /// ## Errors
    ///
    /// This method can return `Err(())` in two cases, either (a) if there has been a newer change
    /// than what the handle has last synced to, that *also* conflicts with this edit, or (b) if
    /// the edit group has already been fixed. In either case, the edit should be discarded (or
    /// carefully modified by a call to [`sync`]) and the `GroupId` changed, if it had one.

    ///
    /// Panics if the [`Diff`] did not agree with the state of the text object at the time of the
    /// last call to [`sync`]. Also panics if either bound of `replace_range` is invalid, e.g.
    /// outside the bound of the line, or a column in the middle of a wide character. A range with
    /// an edit before the start will also cause a panic.
    ///
    /// ## Additional notes
    ///
    /// An interesting interaction to remember here is that the [`updated`] method will return if
    /// *any* change is made -- including from this handle. Because of this, `edit` and
    /// `undo`/`redo` are treated as fallible, standalone requests. Instead of returning the
    /// [`EditResult`] directly, processing changes in case of success must be done by calls to
    /// [`sync`] instead.
